What's YAXX ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
One could consider YAXX as a collection of many pieces of code that have been
developed along a period of 20 years of fun at doing programming.

"toolslib" gathers C++ objects that were missing from the original C++
libraries (and, in my opinion, the gap was never filled
the way Java designers did it later.)

"decnblib" is Mike Cowlishaw's decimal number library, getting rid of the
16-bit arithmetic barrier

"stdiolib" makes a bridge from the C-stdio to java, easing the exchange of
data via streams.

"yasp3lib" is an SGML Parser (SGML being the precursor of XML)

"rexxlib" provides all objects and methods required by the implementation
of the Rexx interpreter (Restructured extended editor)

Fortunately, YAXX is not just a miscellany of heterogeneous (although usefull)
routines.  It provides the means to build a REXX interpreter, and this is how
most people will understand YAXX.

Building YAXX (REXX)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The libraries have been tested in several OS environments, which ascertains
their portability and robustness.
Besides classical OSes (Linux, MS Windows), Palm OS was one of the first
candidate for writing "REXX for Palm OS" at the beginning of the 2000's.
In 2010, REXX was ported to Android...

Rexx on Android
---------------
There are two parts: 1) the .SO libraries; and 2) the android / eclipse project.
The Android Eclipse project -- the GUI layer -- is named "Rexxoid", and can be
retrieved from [NOT YET DONE].

YAXX (this GIT) only builds the .SO libraries, which represents 95% of the
whole edifice.

The ~/yaxx/jni directory contains the makefiles...  Issue:

| cd ~/yaxx
| /path/to/android_ndk/ndk-build
| (ex: /usr/android-ndk-r6/ndk-build)

This produces the .SO files in ~/yaxx/libs/armeabi
"libs/armeabi" needs to be copied in your Android project directory.

One can examine them issuing"
| nm -gC libtoolslib.so
or
| readelf -Ws libtoolslib.so | awk "{print $8}"
