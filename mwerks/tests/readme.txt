Rexx for Palm OS® from Jaxo, Inc.

is an implementation of the Rexx scripting language
that brings "personal programming" to Palm handhelds,
as well as the ability to hyperlink and glue Palm OS
applications and databases to one another through Rexxlets.

Pressing OK will transfer a new application "REXX"
on your handheld.  Please consult http://www.jaxo.com
for more information.

If you have the RexxletHack already installed,
then you *must* disabled it first!
