- make a URIConnection; implement getDoInput(), get DoOutput() -- rather than
what we have in URIEntry! -- makeStream is really openConnection!
- compare 2 URIs!
- CREATOR is only used for writing a new file
  (e.g.: we dont check in read mode)
- use produce in ConsoleFilter
- review PalmConsole (should be a MemStreamBuf)
- flush after Say (interpreter)
- do not bufferize in Trace
- get maxchallocwhatever from "MemoryPriv.h"
- FUZZY not implemented
- STREAM CLOSE (???)

- in t4.r, 8 should be 9
- PresenceBits should be 32 bit long
- test HALT
- in ADDRESS, the return code seems not to be set
- DO NOT ACCEPT LABELS inside DO-END, IF THEN SELECT etc... blocks
- Clean after the interpetation the extra clauses
- implement '=' in interactive trace
- kill the malloc's: use new
- @999
- put the line count within pRxf

- in Interpreter::endInterpret if not interactive, inheritate the SIGS!
- signal on NOTREADY
- handle the CONDITION built-in
- CodeBuffer should derive from StringBuffer.
- Review RC, SIGL, and RESULT.  Their symbols are created by the variable
  handler, and do not match the symbol created by the compiler (so, the
  cache mechanism does not apply.)  I'm not fixing it now, because I'm
  waiting for reference counting so VariableHandler and Compiler can
  share the same Symbol.
- ConstantSymbol should be much more simple (just a Strung would suffice)
- make MapItem IS-A Strung
- rework BuiltIn (getResult() and getArg(int i)
- the RexxNumber 0 and 1 should be Booleans, and there also might be
  the Boolean Strung::True and Strung::False  refcounting them may be
  dangerous for thread safety.
- refcounting: for thread safety, some Strung (RexxNumber) should never
  be refcounted.  This is the case for Nil.  It should be the case for
  all static Strung (normally defined in Strung.h) <<< FIXME.
  (I had the e_Given once a time...)
  AND we should use more of these.
- the Parser issues an error when encounting a dangling end tag.
  it rather should output the bad markup just as text.
  In order to achieve this, look in:
  entity\entmgr.h 306 22:inline UnicodeString OpenEntityCache::getInputBackAt
  entity\entmgr.cpp 137 27:UnicodeString OpenEntity::getInputBackAt
  [these were implemented to reread the DTD - see the original code]
  also: if the data is still in the cache, we should avoid a seek.
- Optimization.  RexxString should use a pool of n x 256 characters.

DONE:
X cleanup #include
X Parser messages should be reported with more infos.
  This is just because some code is missing!
X FileStream: CREATOR and TYPE
X truncate the FileStream
X fix NT sbumbc bug
X remove the backspace removal in IOMgr::readLine (???)
X trace is so slow!
X temp fix in processHostCommand
X use DbQuery and DbGet Record in PalmDbmStream
X upgrade my POL!
X Stack::pop should be destructive and returns nothing.
X LIFO, on input, is not implemented
X LOAD: give it a try
X why I can't see +++RC=...+++ in the log?
X initialize the Arguments from argv[1], [2], etc....
X change the MN enum names into something more understandable
X OPTYPE_PREFIX
X Stack should derive from LinkedList
X CodeBuffer: review the #ifdef ALIGN.  And m_ip should be computed here.
X fix: p0.r, 695: strip('  foo' || '0a'x || '09'x || ' ') expecting: /foo/, found: /foo'1009'x/
X Again, open of an unexisting file crashes
X do max and min built-in as max (e.g.: use the RexxNumbers!)


TO ADD TO THE FOILS:
- the TRACE feature of REXX
- the fact that YASP3 is UnicodeEnabled
