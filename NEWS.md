<i>July 22, 2014 - Horseshoe version (#3)</i>
"Horseshoe" brings a more polished version of Rexxoid "Silverheels":
<ul>
<li>"file" streams (charout and the like)
<pre>
call charout "haddock.txt" "tonnerre de brest"
call charout "/sdcard/haddock.txt" "mille sabords"
</pre>       
<li>implicit start (clicking an a file / email attachment with .rexx extension)
<li>importing a file from the "download" directory into the Rexx Scripts Gallery
</ul> 
The core libraries -- untouched since 2002 -- have been seriously reviewed to compile again on the other OS'es (at least Linux).
